# University-Management-System

This repository encompasses the development of a comprehensive University Management System, illustrating various facets of software engineering such as database design, SQL implementation, PL/SQL scripting, automation scripting, and Java application development.

## Key Features

- **Database Design**: Utilizes structured and normalized schemas for efficient data management.
- **SQL Implementation**: Creation of tables, establishment of relationships, and implementation of CRUD operations.
- **PL/SQL Scripting**: Utilization of stored procedures, functions, and triggers for data manipulation and validation.
- **Automation Scripting**: Incorporates Bash scripts for automated backup and disk space monitoring to ensure system stability and data integrity.
- **Java Application Development**: GUI application developed in Java, adhering to OOP and MVC principles, facilitating the management of students, courses, departments, and enrollments.

## Technologies Utilized

- **Database Management System**: Oracle
- **Languages**: SQL, PL/SQL, Bash, Java
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: JavaFX

## Project Structure

- **Database**: Houses SQL scripts for database creation, table structures, and initial data seeding.
- **PLSQL**: Contains scripts for stored procedures, functions, and triggers implemented in PL/SQL.
- **AutomationScripts**: Comprises Bash scripts for automated backup and disk space monitoring.
- **JavaApplication**: Holds the source code for the Java application developed for managing university data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up an Oracle database environment.
3. Execute the SQL scripts in the `Database` directory to create tables and populate initial data.
4. Run the PL/SQL scripts in the `PLSQL` directory to implement stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
5. Execute the Bash scripts in the `AutomationScripts` directory for automated backup and disk space monitoring.
6. Open the Java project in an IDE, compile, and run the application to manage university data.

With these steps, you'll have the University Management System up and running, enabling efficient management of various university-related data.# University Management System
